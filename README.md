`cat-dog-imageClassifier.py` is an example of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend. Here's a summary of what is happening in the code:

1. Mounting Google Drive: The code starts by mounting the Google Drive to access the image dataset stored in a specific folder.

2. Setting up the data generators: Data generators are created using the `ImageDataGenerator` class from Keras. They preprocess and generate batches of image data on the fly. One generator is created for training data (`train_generator`) and another for validation data (`validation_generator`).

3. Creating the CNN model: A Sequential model is created using Keras, which represents a linear stack of layers. The model consists of multiple Convolutional layers, MaxPooling layers, and fully connected (Dense) layers. These layers are responsible for learning hierarchical representations of the input images.

4. Compiling the model: The model is compiled with a specified loss function (`binary_crossentropy`), an optimizer (`adam`), and evaluation metric (`accuracy`). The `run_eagerly=True` argument is added to enable eager execution.

5. Training the model: The `fit` method is used to train the model. It takes the training and validation data generators as input. The number of epochs and batch size are also specified. During training, the model learns to classify the images by adjusting its internal parameters based on the provided data.

6. Visualizing the training progress: The training and validation accuracy values are plotted over the epochs using Matplotlib. This visualization helps in understanding the model's learning progress and potential overfitting or underfitting.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to train a CNN for image classification using Keras and TensorFlow. It utilizes data generators to efficiently handle large image datasets and visualizes the training progress to monitor the model's performance.
